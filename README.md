# Lites-Out
BASIC Lights Out game for the TRS-80 Color Computer (CoCo)

This is code from my upcoming blog series as I was learning how to play and write this game.

TODO: Insert link, once it is published.

The code is very low-level BASIC. With some of the REMs removed, it should even run on a 4K CoCo, and I was able to easily port it to run on a Commodore VIC-20.

My goal is to take this basic version and enhance it to have a nice user interface and better controls. That blog series is TODO.
